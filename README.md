Test repository for the starting GitHub tutorial
This is a readme file for the test repository I've created as part of a tutorial in learning to use GitHub.
Right now, I'm excited about the idea of being able to use GitHub for Yuletide, because apparently all of my technical learnings come back to Yuletide. Or Wai-te-ata. One or the other.
I'm a bit confused about line breaks.
